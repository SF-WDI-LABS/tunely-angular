## Overview

This sprint we will:
* Add the ability to `update` and `delete` albums

## Add a click listener
1. Let's start with delete. In the `index.html`, make a delete button inside of the `ng-repeat` for albums.
1. To attach an event handler to this button, we can use Angular's `ng-click` attribute like so

  ```html
  <button class='btn btn-danger' ng-click="albumsIndexCtrl.deleteAlbum(album)">Delete Album</button>
  ```
1. This tells Angular to run the function `deleteAlbum()` that's defined in `albumsIndexCtrl` when the button gets clicked. Note that this function passes in the `album` as an argument.

## Delete in the database and the view
1. Now that we have a button that knows to run a function on click, we need to create that function. Inside of our `AlbumsIndexController` define a `deleteAlbum` function like so

  ```js
  vm.deleteAlbum = function (album) {
    $http({
      method: 'DELETE',
      url: '/api/albums/'+ album._id
    }).then(function successCallback(deletedAlbum) {
      var index = vm.albums.indexOf(deletedAlbum);
      vm.albums.splice(index, 1);
    }, function errorCallback(response) {
      console.log('There was an error deleting the data', response);
    });
  }
  ```
1. You can see that in the `successCallback` function, we manipulate `vm.albums` to match the change we just made in the database. This change to `vm.albums` creates an update in the view!
1. Does it work? Does it work? Check in with somebody nearby to see if they have this step working.

## Creating buttons and forms to help us update
1. Let's move on to update. We want an edit button for each album. When clicked, each data field for that album will turn into an input field that can be edited.
1. Luckily, Angular gives us [`ng-show`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngShow) and [`ng-hide`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngHide). Say hello to your new best friends. These hide and show a specific html element based on whether a given condition is true or false.
1. First, let's create an edit button. Put it next to your delete button.

  ```html
  <button class='btn btn-info' ng-hide="editing" ng-click="editing = true">Edit Album</button>
  ```
  This button has a click handler that when clicked, rather than calling a function like we saw with delete, sets a variable called `editing` to `true`. It also knows to hide itself when `editing` is `true`. So basically, right now, this button hides on click. Weird...and awesome!
    > This `editing` variable is an interesting variable. Since it's not defined in our controller, it's only defined within it's current `scope`, which, in this case, is a single loop in our `ng-repeat` loop.

1. Since we've gotten our edit button to hide on when `editing` is true, we can create a "Save Changes" button to show when `editing` is true. Like so:

  ```html
  <button class='btn btn-success' ng-show="editing" ng-click="albumsIndexCtrl.editAlbum(album); editing = false">Save Changes</button>
  ```
  What does this button do?
1. Now we need to figure out how to replace our data with input fields on click of the edit button. Here's an example of how we can do this:

  ```html
  <input ng-show="editing" ng-model="album.name" type="text" class="form-control input-md">
  ```
  Do this for the rest of the inputs.
1. You also need to `ng-hide` the data fields when `editing` is true.
1. How does it look? Does it all hide and show as expected?

## Make the update happen
1. The last step is to write the `vm.editAlbum()` function in the `AlbumsIndexController`. In this function, you need to write an `$http` request to send the new data to the back-end. Then, in the `successCallback` of this `$http` call, you need to think about what do to to make sure the view reflects these updates. Go! <3
