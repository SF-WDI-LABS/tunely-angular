# tunely-angular

Full CRUD single page app (SPA) with MEAN stack. A refactor of tunely with an Angular front end.


## Objectives


This lab begins with just HTML and CSS on the front end and a fully built out back end. Each sprint in the project has its own objectives.  As you work through the project, you'll:

* see how to set up an Express server to serve an Angular front end
* consume a JSON API using Angular's `$http`
* update Angular views using 2-way data binding and Angular's client-side templating
* CRUD albums and embedded songs
* build your toolbox of Angular modules, services, and directives

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, developers should have some familiarity with...

* Express server routes for HTML and static assets
* Express server routes for JSON (`/api` routes), including the controller pattern (see [docs/controllers_example.md](docs/controllers_example.md))
* RESTful route design
* AJAX
* Git and GitHub, including branches
